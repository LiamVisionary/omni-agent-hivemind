# Project Rules

## Changelog Discipline

- Before committing any feature, bug fix, setup change, or user-visible behavior change, update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Every changelog entry must include:
  - local timestamp with timezone
  - short title
  - status: `Uncommitted`, `Committed`, or `Pushed`
  - files or areas changed
  - verification performed
  - intended commit-message summary
- Write the changelog entry while the work is still uncommitted, then update its status after commit/push.
- Before creating a commit, consult the newest relevant changelog entries and use them to write a specific commit message.
- Documentation-only housekeeping may use a concise changelog entry, but should still record the status and commit-message summary.

## Safety

- Do not commit local secrets, private Tailnet IPs, personal vault contents, or machine-specific data.
- Keep collectors private to Tailscale unless the user explicitly asks for another exposure model.
- Prefer read-only fleet inspection by default. Remote mutation/update endpoints need explicit design and safety review.
