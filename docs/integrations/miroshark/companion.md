# MiroShark Companion Integration

MiroShark support is optional. HivemindOS owns real fleet coordination; MiroShark
can run beside it as a scenario rehearsal and swarm simulation engine.

## Integration Model

- HivemindOS checks `/health` on the configured or detected backend.
- HivemindOS detects common local MiroShark installs, including `MIROSHARK_HOME`,
  `~/.openclaw/companions/MiroShark`, and the Codex candidate cache.
- When MiroShark is installed but stopped, the Swarm screen can start it.
- When MiroShark is missing, the Swarm screen offers an install-and-start action.
- The managed setup uses `git`, `uv`, `python3.11`, `docker`, and `screen` when
  available. It starts Neo4j in Docker and runs the MiroShark Flask backend in a
  detached screen session.
- If the HivemindOS runtime environment has `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `LLM_API_KEY`, it can write MiroShark's local `.env`
  automatically with private file mode.

## Local Defaults

MiroShark's launcher serves:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5001`
- Health: `GET /health`
- API docs: `GET /api/docs`
- OpenAPI spec: `GET /api/openapi.yaml`
- Templates: `GET /api/templates/list`
- Simulations: `GET /api/simulation/list`

Set either variable when the backend is somewhere else:

```bash
MIROSHARK_HOME=~/code/MiroShark
MIROSHARK_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIROSHARK_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

Prefer `MIROSHARK_BASE_URL` for server-only configuration. The public variable
is supported for local convenience.

## Zero-Friction Flow

The Swarm tab should never stop at "companion not running." It should show one
of these states:

- **Connected**: open MiroShark or inspect setup details.
- **Detected**: start the local install from the dashboard.
- **Missing**: install and start from the dashboard when prerequisites and an
  API key are available.
- **Needs configuration**: show exactly which prerequisite or key is missing.

Manual fallback commands remain visible in setup details, but they are a backup,
not the primary path.

## Strategy

Use MiroShark for rehearsal:

- test a proposed swarm plan before real execution
- compare likely agent disagreements
- import summaries, stance distributions, and risk signals
- later suggest roles, voting thresholds, and handoff checks

Keep operational swarm state inside HivemindOS:

- task ownership
- agent attribution
- handoffs
- quorum and synthesis decisions
- dashboard-visible execution state
