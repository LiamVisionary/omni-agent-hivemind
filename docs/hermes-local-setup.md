# Hermes Agent Control Room Local Setup

Use a local, read-only-by-default clone of `shannhk/hermes-agent-control-room`
as the seed for one-click VPS and Hermes deployment workflows:

```text
~/agent-control-room
```

Pin the clone to a reviewed commit before running any bootstrap scripts. The
commit below is an example of the version this project was initially inspected
against:

```text
48a1a5a2c3a64416f51b0199a1acc9aba05e6261
```

Safety posture:

- The VPS bootstrap script was inspected but not run.
- Live installers were not executed.
- Docker images were not pulled.
- For audit-only clones, disable pushes with `git remote set-url --push origin DISABLED`.
- The Omni-Agent Hivemind dashboard validates this folder and forwards its path to opted-in agents as context.

Known live-code risks in the upstream bootstrap:

- NodeSource installer
- Docker installer
- Hermes installer
- global npm packages for Claude Code and Codex
- `nousresearch/hermes-agent:latest` in Docker templates

Use the Control Room as docs, templates, registry, runbooks, and task-bus structure on this computer. Install or run Hermes runtime pieces separately only after reviewing/pinning each external dependency.
