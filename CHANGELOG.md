# Changelog

This file records user-visible changes before they are committed. New work should
be added here first, then marked `Committed` or `Pushed` after the git action.

## 2026-05-18 18:38 WITA - Restart Collector During Setup

- Status: Pushed
- Areas changed: Setup script, telemetry collector installer
- Summary: Make setup restart the telemetry collector after reinstalling it so stale remote collectors pick up `/health` version data and `/update`. Switch dashboard startup from production `next start` to the dev server on the configured port.
- Verification: `bash -n setup.sh scripts/install-telemetry-collector.sh`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (warnings only, pre-existing unused-variable warnings), `pnpm build` (pre-existing Turbopack NFT trace warning), and `git diff --check` passed.
- Intended commit message: `Restart collector during setup`

## 2026-05-18 18:26 WITA - Multi-Agent Kanban Board

- Status: Uncommitted
- Areas changed: OpenClaw Kanban API, local Kanban persistence, Kanban dashboard UI, Kanban types and grouping utilities, assimilation manifest
- Summary: Add a Hermes-style multi-agent Kanban surface with local board storage, task create/update/move flows, assignees, tenants, comments, links, archive visibility, and dashboard columns for triage through done.
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (warnings only, pre-existing unused-variable warnings), `pnpm build` (pre-existing Turbopack NFT trace warning), `git diff --check`, Kanban API smoke test against local dev server, and `verify_assimilation_manifest.py` passed.
- Intended commit message: `Add multi-agent Kanban board`

## 2026-05-18 18:24 WITA - Clear Stale Collector Update Failures

- Status: Pushed
- Areas changed: Fleet update API, remote update fallback errors
- Summary: Make remote machine updates fall back from Tailscale SSH to plain SSH when possible, and replace the raw host-key failure with a clear stale-collector/bootstrap message when the collector is reachable but cannot update itself yet.
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (warnings only, pre-existing unused-variable warnings), `pnpm build` (pre-existing Turbopack NFT trace warning), and `git diff --check` passed.
- Intended commit message: `Clarify stale collector update failures`

## 2026-05-18 18:17 WITA - Preflight Tailscale SSH Host Keys

- Status: Pushed
- Areas changed: Fleet update API, Tailscale SSH update fallback, changelog status correction
- Summary: Prime the target machine's SSH host key before the first `tailscale ssh` update attempt, while keeping the existing retry for first-use host-key errors. Correct the previous host-key handling changelog hash after the amended push.
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (warnings only, pre-existing unused-variable warnings), `pnpm build` (pre-existing Turbopack NFT trace warning), `git diff --check`, and `ssh-keyscan` against the VPS Tailnet hostname passed. Restarted the local production server on port 5020.
- Intended commit message: `Preflight Tailscale SSH host keys`

## 2026-05-18 18:08 WITA - Omni-Agent Hivemind Branding

- Status: Uncommitted
- Areas changed: App metadata, hero branding, runtime status placement, README/docs title references, package name, public logo and favicon assets
- Summary: Add the supplied Omni-Agent Hivemind logo throughout the app, generate browser icons and favicon assets, rename visible app title surfaces from OpenClaw Next to Omni-Agent Hivemind, and move runtime status checking out of the hero into the selected-agent workspace.
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (warnings only, pre-existing unused-variable warnings), `pnpm build` (pre-existing Turbopack NFT trace warning), and `git diff --check` passed.
- Intended commit message: `Add Omni-Agent Hivemind branding`

## 2026-05-18 18:01 WITA - Tailscale SSH Host Key Handling

- Status: Pushed in `5c4187f`
- Areas changed: Tailscale SSH fallback transport, update error copy feedback
- Summary: Avoid first-use host key failures by detecting `tailscale ssh` host-key errors, priming `~/.ssh/known_hosts` with `ssh-keyscan` for the Tailnet host, then retrying the update. Make the update error Copy button visibly switch to `Copied`.
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (warnings only), `pnpm build`, `git diff --check`, and `ssh-keyscan` against the VPS Tailnet hostname passed.
- Intended commit message: `Fix Tailscale SSH update host key handling`

## 2026-05-18 17:48 WITA - Robust Direct Update Errors

- Status: Pushed in `daf7089`
- Areas changed: Tailscale SSH update fallback, machine update UI, changelog status cleanup
- Summary: Fix direct update failures caused by brittle remote shell quoting by streaming a script through `tailscale ssh ... bash -s`. Make update errors visible in selectable text with a copy button instead of trapping the message inside a button label.
- Verification: `node --check scripts/agent-telemetry-collector.mjs`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (warnings only), `pnpm build`, `git diff --check`, and a local `/api/fleet/update` error-path smoke test passed. The fallback script now renders as multiline `bash -s` input with valid `[ -d ... ]` spacing and remote `$HOME` expansion.
- Intended commit message: `Fix fleet update fallback and errors`

## 2026-05-18 17:39 WITA - One-Click Fleet Updates

- Status: Pushed in `c3621de`
- Areas changed: collector update endpoint, dashboard update action, fleet update API, machine update UI
- Summary: Make machine Update buttons execute directly out of the box. New collectors run a built-in `/update` endpoint; dashboards call it directly and fall back to Tailscale SSH for older collectors when available.
- Verification: `node --check scripts/agent-telemetry-collector.mjs`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (warnings only), `pnpm build`, `tailscale ssh --help`, and a local `/api/fleet/update` error-path smoke test passed.
- Intended commit message: `Add one-click fleet updates`

## 2026-05-18 17:34 WITA - Project Changelog Rule

- Status: Pushed in `407e066`
- Areas changed: `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`
- Summary: Added a project rule requiring all future features and meaningful fixes to be documented in `CHANGELOG.md` with timestamps, commit status, verification, and an intended commit-message summary before commit.
- Verification: Documentation-only change; no runtime verification required.
- Intended commit message: `Add changelog discipline rule`
